# Azure Search Speech Recognition Sample using Cortana for Windows Phone
This is a sample that demonstrates how to use speech recognition from a Windows Phone to make searched against Azure Search.  The Azure Search index consists of a set of data provided by the USGS as part of data.gov of Trails around the USA.  Using Azure Search geo-spatial support you can find trails that are located in close proximity to yourself, or simply request a trail by name.

The sample is split into 3 parts, which is important if you are following the course materials from the [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/liveevents/adding-microsoft-azure-search-to-your-websites-and-apps).  To see the final version of the application, please use the project located in TrailFinder-Part3.
